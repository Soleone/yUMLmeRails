yUMLmeRails
===========

This is a simple plugin that adds Rake tasks to display model diagrams for RoR apps.

It uses an extended RailRoad to output yUML diagrams which are drawn using the service at http://yuml.me

There's also a small Shoes app to display the downloaded diagram.

Requirements:

    - Shoes
    - wget (I'm using it to dowload the image for now since openuri wasn't found of my URI)
    
Instalation:

    - Just clone this into vendor/plugins
    
Usage (rake -T) :
  
    - rake yUMLmeRails:download            # Download yUML model diagram
    - rake yUMLmeRails:show                # Show model diagram
    - rake yUMLmeRails:url                 # Get yUML URL
    
Feel free to do whatever you want with the code but please share your results with us.
